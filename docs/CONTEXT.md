## Product

Evo Rentals is an India-focused electric two-wheeler rental ERP covering
customers, KYC, fleet, bookings, rentals, collections, inspections, settlement,
service, reporting, employees, notifications, and settings.

The first production lifecycle is:

`Customer/KYC -> availability -> booking -> rental -> collection -> return -> settlement`

Product source material is under `D:\Evo Rentals`. Treat aspirational design
documents as requirements, but verify the live schema before implementing them.

## Technology

- Next.js 16.2.10 App Router and React 19
- TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4
- Radix/shadcn-style components, TanStack Table, Recharts, Zod
- Supabase Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, and RLS
- Vercel production deployment from GitHub `main`
- INR, Indian formats, `Asia/Kolkata`

Read the bundled Next.js documentation under `node_modules/next/dist/docs`
before using framework APIs. This project uses `src/proxy.ts`.

## Verified completed work

### Day 1 - application foundation

- Responsive dashboard shell, sidebar, top navigation, cards, charts, tables,
  loading/error primitives, and dark-first theme
- Dashboard and operational module foundations using demonstration data

### Day 2 - platform and tenancy

- Company-scoped tenancy and RLS
- Tenant helper functions in the private schema
- Branch tenancy deliberately removed; branch may remain operational metadata
- Migrations `202607280002` through `202607280004`

### Day 3 - authentication and customers

- Supabase email/password login and protected dashboard routes
- Forgot-password, PKCE callback, new-password, session proxy, and error states
- Browser-side recovery initiation so the PKCE verifier survives the email flow
- Live customer directory, detail, creation, addresses, KYC reviews, timeline
- Private `customer-documents` storage structure and policies
- Migrations `202607280005` and `202607280006`

## Live versus placeholder functionality

Live:

- Authentication and session protection
- Customer directory, customer details, creation, and KYC review
- Company-scoped customer data and policies

Mock or placeholder:

- Dashboard metrics and charts
- Bookings, fleet, rentals, payments, and service operational data
- Drivers, employees, settings, reports, and notifications

Do not describe placeholder screens as backend-complete.

## Known issues and debt

- Supabase built-in email provider permits only two project-wide Auth emails per
  hour. Configure custom SMTP before production onboarding.
- Logout and displayed profile identity are not connected to the authenticated
  user; the navigation still contains hardcoded identity values.
- Customer editing is missing.
- KYC document signed view/download is not wired.
- Notification drawer and live counts are not wired.
- No automated tests currently cover auth, RLS isolation, or customer workflows.
- The legacy base schema has no rebuildable `0001` baseline migration.
- Audit events, full RBAC, and updated-at conventions remain incomplete.

## Mandatory implementation patterns

1. UI components must use typed domain services rather than query Supabase.
2. Server actions authenticate with `getActor()`, authorize company scope, and
   validate FormData with Zod.
3. Business tables carry `company_id`; policies enforce company isolation.
4. Database snake_case maps explicitly to TypeScript camelCase.
5. Private storage paths use `{company_id}/{entity_id}/...`.
6. Never expose storage paths or privileged keys to browser code.
7. Validate Indian phone, address, PIN, INR, and timezone conventions.
8. Match the supplied dark operations-dashboard design language and verify both
   dark and light themes.

## Schema reality

- Existing base tables are legacy remote tables and are not represented by a
  complete baseline migration.
- Product database documents outside the app may describe an aspirational schema.
- Verify live columns, constraints, enum values, and RLS before new migrations.
- Continue migration numbering after `202607280006`.
- Only one active task may own a new migration sequence.

## Immediate next action

Claim a Day 4 task from `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`. Recommended first task: `D4-01`,
connect logout and real authenticated profile identity.

## Progress log

| Day | Date | Delivered | Handoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2026-07-27 | UI shell and mock operations pages | Repository history |
| 2 | 2026-07-28 | Company tenancy and RLS | `DAY_02_PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md` |
| 3 | 2026-07-28 to 2026-07-29 | Auth, customers/KYC, recovery fixes | `DAY_03_CUSTOMER_KYC.md` |

## Handoff rule

At the end of every task, update this checkpoint with:

- last verified commit and deployment;
- completed and remaining scope;
- migration status;
- validation evidence;
- blockers and exact next action.
